# LPC2148 Peripherals

This repository features code developed for my college course on Embedded Signal Processing Architectures in the academic year 2022-23, specifically for the LPC2148 microcontroller.
It includes interfaces for several peripherals, such as:

- GPIO
- Interrupt Controller
- PWM
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- SMS using UART
- Timer
- RTC
